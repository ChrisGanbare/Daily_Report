# This document is deprecated.

This document described the old code architecture, including modules like `report_controller`, `db_handler`, and the `ui` package.

This architecture has been completely refactored into a modern, layered web application structure (API -> Service -> Repository).

This document needs to be rewritten from scratch to describe the new architecture.
